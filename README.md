### Important
Due to the fact that this API was developed using **.NET Core 3.1** you will need to use **Visual Studio 2019** to run it, as older versions of the IDE do no support this SDK.

# Instructions

## Download and execute the code
The easiest way to run this API is to:

1. Press the green "Code" button in the top right corner and select "Download ZIP". 
2. Unzip the downloaded folder.
3. In Visual Studio 2019, under the "File" menu, select "Open" and then "Project/Solution...".
4. In the window that opens, you need to navigate to the unzipped file location and select "CustomerAPI.sln". This will load the full project.
5. Once the project is loaded in Visual Studio you simply need to press F5 and then the page that will open will give you further instructions.

## Test the code
On top of the system testing that you can perform by running the project, I also wrote unit tests to check that the API endpoints behave in the desired manner. In order to run those you need to:

1. Identify "Solution Explorer" in Visual Studio 2019.
2. Find the project named "CustomerAPI_Tests".
3. Right click on the project and select the option "Run tests".
4. This will open the "Test Explorer" window and it will start running the tests.
