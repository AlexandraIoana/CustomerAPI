# Instructions
The easiest way to run this API is to:

1. Press the green "Code" button in the top right corner and select "Download ZIP". 

2. Unzip the downloaded folder.

3. In Visual Studio 2019, under the "File" menu, select "Open" and then "Project/Solution...".

4. In the window that opens, you need to navigate to the unzipped file location and select "CustomerAPI.sln". This will load the full project.

5. Once the project is loaded in Visual Studio you simply need to press F5 and then the page that will open will give you further instructions.


### Important

Due to the fact that this API was developed using **.NET Core 3.1** you will need to use **Visual Studio 2019** to run it, as older versions of the IDE do no support this SDK.
